### What is Bitcoin
- first cryptocurrency
- transparent
- scarce: through mining restricted no of blocks and only 21 million bitcoin will ever be produced
-  open-source

> Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto a pseudonymous computer scientist who is the creator of blockchain technology which is a brilliant solution to the double-spending problem. Satoshi launched bitcoin in 2009 and disappeared.

### What is Ethereum
- Decentralized computing platform
- Ether is the currency that powers the Ethereum network
- Programs can't be tampered with by external parties

> Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer who is best known as one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Buterin became involved with cryptocurrency early in its inception, co-founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011. In 2014, Buterin launched Ethereum.

### What is Blockchain
- distributed database
- stores all sorts of digital data
- multiple copies of a specific database i.e synchronized database
- chain of linked blocks
