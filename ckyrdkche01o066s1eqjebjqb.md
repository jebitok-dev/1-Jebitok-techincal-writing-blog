Yesterday I attended a technical writing event hosted by [I4G Unilag Chapter](https://twitter.com/I4GUNILAG) where speakers shared more about how one can get started or improve on their technical writing skill and I thought I could share it here as it could be of help to one or two who might be reading through this article.

The first guest was [Joel Adewole](https://twitter.com/wolz_codelife) who is a Fulstsack developer(Python and Javascript) at [Tunga](Tunga.io) and a technical who covered everything technical writing

## Understanding Nitty-gritty of Technical Writing
Technical writing is the process of creating and managing written content about a particular subject that requires guidance, instruction, explanation, or analysis for readers to relate or interact well with the subject. One doesn't have to be a coder, data scientist, designer, or given tech specialist in order to be a technical writer.

### Types of technical writing
A technical writer can focus on writing either:
- software/end-user documentation
- QA solutions
- how-to-guide and tutorials
- business proposals
- project requirement documents
- research papers & reports
- white papers
- product recall
- resumes

### Why Technical writing
**Essentials of Technical Writing**
On can focus on technical writing for:
- providing content for others to fall back to in future
- providing various opinions on certain subjects
- essentially making information circulate
- companies that need it to promote their products
- business to show analysis to stakeholders

### benefits of technical writing
***For audience***
They can benefit from content that:
- gives a how-to-guide that provides clear directives on how to use the subject for example tutorials on how to deploy on Heroku.
- serves as a point of reference to the subject

***For writers***
Technical writers benefit from technical writing as helps them:-
- improve research skills i.e while writing articles one might have content but they'll still have to still research additional information and link relevant information that might benefit the target audience. 
- master better communication i.e as a technical writer most often you'll but conscious of potential readers, tenses of speech, or even Grammarly 
- create a professional presentation i.e most technical writers can share their work on their social profiles or even add to resume or portfolio
- creates connections i.e as you grow as a technical writer you get to connect with other technical writers, your readers who might leave a comment or relate to your content, or potential clients who might want to work with you because of your skill

The second speaker was [Olamide Makinde](https://twitter.com/tiaraoluwanimi_): content & technical writer, SheCodeAfrica lead who had an AMA session. Before getting into technical writing she had experience writing non-tech content then started writing various concepts for SheCodeAfrica and volunteering before pitching for paid writing opportunities.

- mostly she wanted things to be perfect but wasn't sure when she wanted to write in public how will people would react if it wasn't good. In the long run, she has learned to write in public to get feedback and build her skills
- *being a good writer*: volunteer writing has been helpful together with consistency. Unlike developers and designers, technical writers are viewed as "small" in the space but meeting other people in technical writing communities has been encouraging to her.
- *rejection emails*: while pitching in technical writing paid to blog, or guest writing she got a lot of rejections even when talking with other writers they had experienced the same but they didn't stop trying. Just keep applying and waiting for feedback or time they’ll accept you.
- *write*: there’s no rush or limit in writing
- having an accountability partner rather than mentor to keep you accountable or help read your content if they're in the same field as you.
- *the fear that many people have written this topic* before shouldn't stop you from writing on the said topic.
- why write the article: people know this concept, save time, know your worth/target audience
