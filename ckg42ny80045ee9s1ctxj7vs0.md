Recently, [Hashnode](hashnode.com) launched it's #HashnodeBootcamp with its aim of helping most developers or people in the tech space to grow their technical writing skills.

Over the Bootcamp period, we were privileged to have four sessions facilitated by experienced writers in the tech space, and each session hosted by [Hashnode's Co-founder](https://hashnode.com/@sandeep). As attendees, we spent the first part of the session being taken through a presentation, and in the last part of the session, we would ask questions in relation to technical writing.

Here are some of the tips picked from first session facilitated by [Catalin Tech](https://catalins.tech/): 
1. English:- use of grammar checking sites like [grammarly extension](grammarly.com) or [Hamingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) will help improves your writing.

- Writing articles from a Technical Writing point of View
- Writing for your Audience
- Define targeted audience & interest i.e Junior Developer(less complex topics if not it will be less likely for them to visit your blog), mobile development (Android/ Flutter / Kotlin)
- Find your niche e.g writing for fellow Junior Developers 
                terms & concepts
                simple tutorials
- use of bullet points to tailor your key points:
        Basic rules for the list: ordered vs unordered lists
- Use an *unordered list* for things you cant put in order like: happier, better health
- *numbered list* for action verbs like "go to google", "search for" and a full stop at the end.  List of instructions on what one should do in a specific order. This helps shorten articles and helps the reader

- split articles into sections 
   . using simple words and short sentences
   . use one idea per sentence & paragraph
   . avoid passive voice & use active voice
   . use acronyms properly
   . use a descriptive sentence to start a paragraph
   . write a lot is a good way to only learn 
   . space between articles to ease reading

** Possible path to write paid articles **

1. Start your blog:- use [hashnode](hashnode.com)
2. Write about topics in your area of expertise i.e web developer etc
3. Write consistently start with at least one article per week and establish a schedule.
4. Focus on providing quality:- if people will be moved they'll share.
5. Pitch [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) to write for them since they have editors who review your articles and give feedback on how to improve before publishing and your articles are exposed to millions of people.
 

**Your Blog**
consider yourself a personal recruiter looking for an audience from social media, google, etc.
Focus on Hashnode so that you concentrate on the content since you already have the Hashnode community.
