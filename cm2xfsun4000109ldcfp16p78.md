Obfuscation is still unclear to me but there’s this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/8SmJNWiMouo?si=WQyz1dQCNNU1gk2E) that has a walkthrough from around minute 26 and also use this [Javascript Obfuscator Tool](https://obfuscator.io/) as well as tools like ChatGPT for more deep dive into the topic 15. Is it a good practice to blindly include JS in your code from any source (yea/nay)? `nay`
