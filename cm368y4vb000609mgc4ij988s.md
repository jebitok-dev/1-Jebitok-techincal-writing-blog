In this article, I will write a write-up for Network Security that covers Methodology and Practical Examples of Network Security.

1. What type of firewall is Windows Defender Firewall? `Host Firewall`
    
2. During which step of the Cyber Kill Chain does the attacker gather information about the target? `Recon`
    
    Let’s summarize what we have done in this task to get `root` access on the target system of IP address `MACHINE_IP`:
    
    1. We used `nmap` to learn about the running services.
        
    2. We connected to the FTP server to learn more about its configuration.
        
    3. We discovered a file containing the root password mistakenly copied to a public folder.
        
    4. We used the password we found, allowing us to log in successfully.
        
    5. We gained access to all the users’ files.
        
3. What is the password in the `secret.txt` file? `ABC789xyz123`
    
4. What is the content of the `flag.txt` in the `/root` directory? `THM{FTP_SERVER_OWNED}`
    
5. What is the content of the `flag.txt` in the `/home/librarian` directory? `THM{LIBRARIAN_ACCOUNT_COMPROMISED}`
