In this article, we’ll cover Azure - Wareville's Key Vault, which grew three sizes that day. The write-up is called the Day 16 challenge of the Advent of Cyber event challenge. It was interesting to navigate through the Azure platform to access the bash terminal and run commands. We’re still at Wareville for SOC-mas!

## **Intro to Azure**

Before diving into the Glitch's idea of the attacker's path, let's introduce some of the key concepts that will be covered in the process. We are going to start by introducing Azure. To do that, let's consider why McSkidy is using Azure in the first place.

It all started when McSkidy's role as the cyber security expert of Wareville really started to take off. Before she knew it, McSkidy was in very high demand and needed to create all kinds of resources to help her organise her duties; these included a web application to handle appointment making, multiple machines running for investigations, and more machines running for evidence storing and analysis. McSkidy hosted and managed all of these machines herself, that is, on-prem (on-premises). This initially wasn't a massive issue because, after all, she wasn't a corporation but just helping the citizens of Wareville with cyber security matters.

However, as time went on, McSkidy ran into issues during peak times when she would receive many requests for help, and therefore needed to process more evidence. All of this increased demand meant McSkidy had to scale up her resources to handle the load. To put a long story short, this was a lot of hassle for McSkidy. She wished there was a way for someone to handle her infrastructure on her behalf, especially when scaling her resources up (during peak times) and down (when they resumed). That's when Azure came to the rescue.

Azure is a CSP (Cloud Service Provider), and CSPs (others include Google Cloud and AWS) provide computing resources such as computing power on demand in a highly scalable fashion. In other words, McSkidy could instead have Azure manage her underlying infrastructure, scaling it in times of increased demand and decreasing it once traffic resumed to normal levels. The best bit? McSkidy only has to pay for what she uses; gone were the days of buying physical infrastructure to handle increased loads, only for that infrastructure to go unused the majority of the time.

Azure (and cloud adoption in general) boasts many benefits beyond cost optimisation. Azure also gave McSkidy access to lots of cloud services ranging from identity management to data ingestion (quite frankly, there are more services than can be abbreviated in a sentence as, at the time of writing, there are over 200), these services can be used to build, deploy, and manage McSkidy's current infrastructure as well as give her the options to upgrade or build new applications in the future given the range of services available. A couple of Azure services will come up during the Glitch's attack path. Let's take a look at them now:

**Azure Key Vault**

Azure Key Vault is an Azure service that allows users to securely store and access secrets. These secrets can be anything from API Keys, certificates, passwords, cryptographic keys, and more. Essentially, anything you want to keep safe, away from the eyes of others, and easily configure and restrict access to is what you want to store in an Azure Key Vault.

The secrets are stored in vaults, which are created by vault owners. Vault owners have full access and control over the vault, including the ability to enable auditing so a record is kept of who accessed what secrets and grant permissions for other users to access the vault (known as **vault consumers**). McSkidy uses this service to store secrets related to evidence and has been entrusted to store some of Wareville's town secrets here.

**Microsoft Entra ID**

McSkidy also needed a way to grant users access to her system and be able to secure and organize their access easily. So, a Wareville town member could easily access or update their secret. Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) is Azure's solution. Entra ID is an identity and access management (IAM) service. In short, it has the information needed to assess whether a user/application can access X resource. In the case of the Wareville town members, they made an Entra ID account, and McSkidy assigned the appropriate permissions to this account.
