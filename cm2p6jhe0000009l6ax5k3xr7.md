In this article, I will write a write-up for Wireshark: The Basic that covers how Tool Overview, Packet Dissection, Packet Navigation, and Packet Filtering.

1. Which file is used to **simulate** the screenshots? `http1.pcapng`
    
2. Which file is used to **answer** the questions? `Exercise.pcapng`  
      
    **Use the "Exercise.pcapng" file to answer the questions.**
    
3. Read the **"capture file comments"**. What is the flag? `TryHackMe_Wireshark_Demo`  
      
    Once you’ve opened the Exercise.pcapng file check the Statistics &gt; Capture File Properties (it will answer the next questions)

    **Use the "Exercise.pcapng" file to answer the questions.**
    
11. Search the **"r4w" string** in packet details. What is the name of artist 1? `r4w8173`
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729883736206/6818d49a-abb2-4b03-892d-ce241cda64be.png align="center")

    Search packet number 39765 as shown above, then once you have it, highlight it and pick File &gt; Export Packet Bytes then it will be saved into the Desktop folder. Once it’s saved you’ll need to get the hash by using the `md5sum` command.
