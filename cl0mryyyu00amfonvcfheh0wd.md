The blockchain industry has grown famous and has attracted a spontaneous amount of curious people ready to learn and skill up considering the different levels of unemployment/underemployment all over the world. The blockchain industry has given opportunities to Traders, Event organizers, Marketers, tech experts from Developers, Designers, DevOps engineers, Game developers, Q&A Testers, project managers, Developer advocates. This week I had my first talk for the year and I had an opportunity to talk about how to get started as a smart contract developer and shared a couple of resources that I thought would be of help to someone who might read through this article.

Here is a list of prerequisites required to get started:-
- Basic understanding of web2: HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT among other programming languages
- Have an interest in blockchain technology: understand general basics of blockchain technology itself, and how it works(immutability,  public ledger), blockchain use-cases like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others from cryptocurrencies, Decentralized finance, NFTs, Metaverse among others
- Have a general understanding of the characteristics of blockchain
    - immutable
    - traceability
    - privacy protection
    - independence
- learn the different blockchain networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Stacks, Celo, among others
- get started with smart contract development: smart contract development language(Rust, Solidity, or Clarity)
- For beginners, it's advisable to pick Ethereum blockchain development as it has many use cases, a lot of learning resources free & paid online and there are a lot of EVM compatible chains that you can work with or build on.

### solidity and smart contract development

- get basics of solidity programming language
- start writing smart contracts, compiling and deploying using solidity on IDEs like Remix
- write different smart contract use-cases like 
[ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) contract, [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) Fungible Token & [EIP-721: NFT standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
- use libraries and frameworks like Hardhat, Truffle and write tests of the contracts youâ€™re writing
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)/[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Runs JavaScript
    - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - Useful framework
    - [Hardhat - Typescript Support](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html)
    - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - Your Ethereum wallet
    - [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/index.html) - Your localhost blockchain
    - [Web3.Js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/) - Connects sites to blockchain
    - [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/) - check transactions
- attend boot camps that teach smart contract development or get resources online. Also constantly follow the different blockchain networks as they constantly hold hackathons and training for people interested in smart contract development.
