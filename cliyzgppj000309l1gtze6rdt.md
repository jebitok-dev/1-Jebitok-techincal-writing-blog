HD Games in collaboration with HER DAO organized a hackathon on Dora Hacks for this challenge. I have picked to work on the Mantle track and within it, I chose to pick the Best Content category specifically the technical writing part in order to help break down what Mantle Network is, how you can build on Mantle as a developer, Some project building on Mantle and how you can submit your project, also the job board within the Mantle Network the roles you can find, how to join community ecosystem, the open grant and how you can apply among other things. Hope you enjoy the article:

It’s the first modular layer-2 chain on Ethereum. Developers can build on Mantle as: it’s EVM compatible: you can write contracts and deploy on Mantle, Ethereum, or any other chain that is EVM compatible. It also aims on scaling Ethereum. It allows developers to build web3 apps and deploy smart contracts in an efficient and low-fee environment.

### Features of Mantle

Mantle has a couple of features and improvements that set it apart from other Layer-2 solutions built on top of Ethereum:

* Modular Data Availability
    

It uses an optimistic rollup with an innovative data availability solution which allows it to inherit security from Ethereum and offer cheaper and more accessible data availability. Unlike Ethereum, validator nodes in the Mantle network collect transactions from users and commit to Ethereum in the form of a compressed block which saves the gas fees and increases the total possible throughput for transactions.

* Multi-Party Computation(MPC)
    

It uses MPC to minimize the trust risk of L2 execution results by distributing processes and execution among multiple parties without them having to reveal any private data. Specialized nodes contribute to multi-party signatures that improve the correctness of off-chain execution results through the Threshold Signature Scheme(TSS)

* Decentralized Sequencer
    

It will progressively decentralize its sequencer to offer secure and trustless block production by rotating around a permissionless sequencer set it will reduce potential single points of failure or censorship on the network.

### Building on Mantle Network
