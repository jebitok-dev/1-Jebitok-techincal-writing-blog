TryHackMe has released a new Learning Path challenge i.e. Cybersecurity 101 with over $28,000 worth of prizes for grabs in the form of multiple tickets which can be redeemed as TryHackMe vouchers, DEFCON 2025 tickets, Amazon gifts, and TryHackMe t-shirts, among others.

This article will cover one of the rooms on this challenge which covers the evaluation of Search Skills, Search Engines, Specialized Search Engines, Vulnerabilities and Exploitation, Technical Documentation, and Social Media.

According to THM, a quick Google search for “learn cyber security” returned around 600 million hits, while a search for “learn hacking” returned more than double that number! The number might have grown even further when you go through this room.
