Stacks enables smart contracts on top of bitcoin. Stacks uses the proof of transfer mechanism which provides scalability, security, and energy-efficient smart contracts. Bitcoin records blocks of stacks blockchain giving it a unique security advantage. 

Smart contracts on Stacks are written using a programming language called [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/overview). 

### Solidity vs Clarity
- Ethereum 1% of smart contracts have source code whereas for Stacks 100% of smart contracts have source code.
- For Ethereum, 99% of smart contracts require users to trust developers whereas Stacks is truly trustless for end users.
- Ethereum is Turing-complete i.e contract output can't be reliably verified whereas Stacks is Turing-incomplete i.e decidable, all contract output can be reliably verified.

### Stacks Team 

Stacks is based on years of distributed systems Research & Development i.e the team is made up of:-
- six distributed systems Ph.D. holders
- two scientists with presidential career awards
- 15,000+ research citations among whitepaper  authors
- research published at USENIX ATC, DCCL
- Board members at MongoDB, Twilio, Etsy

Stacks de-risks blockchain startups by offering technical support and code auditing, recruiting skilled technical talent, validating and attracting customers, identifying blockchain use cases, and introductions to smart money investors. 

Startups accepted into stacks accelerator bares key traits like:- skilled technical teams have proven by tracks record, full-time commitment, thoughtful and balanced equity share, have practical plans, strategies, and intellectual flexibility, ready to move fast when accelerator program starts and consists of underrepresented founders. These startups should also be already building on the Stacks ecosystem.

Startups building through stacks accelerator programs are focused on big problems and plans with a team uniquely suited to solve them into differentiated solutions. The projects leverage unique features of stacks and are based on high-stakes use cases.

The stacks Accelerator program is a 3-month program where the first month is all about product development which comprises start-up training, Stacks tech support, branding, and marketing strategies, and product.
