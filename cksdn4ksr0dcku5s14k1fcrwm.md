Starting today [Zuri Internship](https://zuri.team) popularly referred to as HNG internship is set to begin its hngi8 program. The internship runs once yearly and it is run by Nigerian-based developers, the program has many mentors and attracts over 10,000 interns from all over the world who get invited into a Slack workspace where announcements and various channels are created.

The program has several tracks I.e frontend, backend, mobile app, UI/UX design, DevOps, and digital marketing. The last three tracks have a limited number of interns accepted into it. The program looks into using Golang as the main backend programming language. 

The internship is quite competitive one has to move from one stage to another and to be able to move you have to submit required tasks on time and to follow instructions. In some cases, for developers, PRs have to approve to be considered valid in order for you to move to the next stage, for designers your Figma design link has to have had all iterations corrected. Once one is moved into the next stage, they are added into a new slack for the respective stage and the Zuri dashboard is updated. If you're not moving to stage you might be added to the probation channel then engage with mentors might get consideration if you have a valid reason to be moved to the next stage or have your account deactivated.

My major goal for this internship is to build my skills as a software developer and to be able to move from one stage to the other. This means having to follow instructions, work closely with my teams & team leads as well as mentors. I'm still unsure of the track that I'm going to settle for between frontend and backend(node.js) by stage 3 I should have settled for one. 

To be able to progress well through this internship. Git and GitHub are necessary skills as PR links will be submitted to prove that one completed their task. Here is a good [Nodejs crash course](https://youtu.be/zb3Qk8SG5Ms) by NetNinja on Youtube if you still have a challenge with it.

The reason I'm having a divided mind for frontend is due to my CSS skills I'm to work on Flex and Grid to help with positioning challenges. Personally, [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) documentation, [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and StackOverflow are the best for CSS.

For node.js, the tutorial by Net Ninja on YouTube works well 

I'm looking to networking with more developers, designers, and DevOps experts. Also a chance to see many talented people worth looking up to. The last hngi7 I made up to stage 7 so I'm looking forward to doing better and finalist is the major goal as well as building more skills as the program assimilated real-world experience.

Wishing the best to all participants of  HGNi8 from interns, mentors, and program organizers. Journey Enroute being world-class developers/designers/DevOps. If you are interested in joining the program check [here](https://internship.zuri.team) for registration which closes early this week
