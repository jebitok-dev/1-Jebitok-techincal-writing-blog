As a software developer one frequently uses a browser as part of key tools. It could be [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), or any other browser of choice. There are sites that we frequently look upon the browser and some of these sites or tools have come up with browser extensions to make your work more efficient. The browser extensions might be available across all browsers or limited to one. 

Here is a list of top Chrome browser extensions I frequently use as a developer:-

- [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)

It eliminates grammar errors, detects plagiarism, and easily improves any text. It also allows you to:-
>  - communicate with impact by ensuring everything you write comes across the way you intend.
 - present your best self every time you type by making your writing clear and engaging. 

As a developer more often you're told not to apologize about your English since it might not be a  but spelling error and poorly written sentences are considered careless that's why it's important to have Grammarly extensions. Grammarly will check any forms especially input areas with type as text.

- [Loom](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-for-chrome/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb)

From onboarding new employees, troubleshooting customer issues, or code reviews, Loom makes it easy to get your message across quickly and clearly using the power of video.

Loom enables the recording of short videos by either sharing screen with the camera or without. It is good for recording an overview of your project for project description on the ReadME file or while submitting for code review. Reviewers can leave comments or also record comments and share links. 

In case you're requested to record a small video of yourself while making an application or to be featured somewhere you can use Loom.
