In this article, I will write a write-up for IDS Fundamentals that covers What is an IDS, Types of IDS, IDS Examples: Snort, Snort Usage, and a Practical.

1. Can an intrusion detection system (IDS) prevent the threat after it detects it? Yea/Nay `Nay`
    
2. Which type of IDS is deployed to detect threats throughout the network? `Network Intrusion Detection System`
    
3. Which IDS leverages both signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques? `Hybrid IDS`
    
4. Which mode of Snort helps us to log the network traffic in a PCAP file? `Packet Logging Mode`
    
5. What is the primary mode of Snort called? `Network Intrusion Detection System Mode`
    
6. Where is the main directory of Snort that stores its files? `/etc/snort`
    
7. Which field in the Snort rule indicates the revision number of the rule? `rev`
    
8. Which protocol is defined in the sample rule created in the task? `icmp`
    
9. What is the file name that contains custom rules for Snort? `local.rules`
    
10. What is the IP address of the machine that tried to connect to the subject machine using SSH? `10.11.90.211`  
      
    `$ cd /etc/snort   $ sudo snort -r Intro_to_IDS.pcap -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console`

11. What other rule message besides the SSH message is detected in the PCAP file? `Ping Detected`
    
12. What is the sid of the rule that detects SSH? `1000002`
