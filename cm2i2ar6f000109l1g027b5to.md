In this article, we’ll cover the [Introduction to LAN](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/introtolan) room on TryHackMe which includes an Introduction to LAN Topologies, a Primer on Subnetting, The ARP Protocol, and the DHCP Protocol.

1. What does LAN stand for? `Local Area Network`
    
2. What is the verb given to the job that Routers perform? `Routing`
    
3. What device is used to centrally connect multiple devices on the local network and transmit data to the correct location? `Switch`
    
4. What topology is cost-efficient to set up? `Bus Topology`
    
5. What topology is expensive to set up and maintain? `Star Topology`
    
6. Complete the interactive lab attached to this task. What is the flag given at the end? `THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}`

7. What is the technical term for dividing a network up into smaller pieces? `Subnetting`
    
8. How many **bits** are in a subnet mask? `32`
    
9. What is the range of a section (octet) of a subnet mask? `0-255`
    
10. What address is used to identify the start of a network? `Network Address`
    
11. What address is used to identify devices within a network? `Host Address`
    
12. What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network? `Default Gateway`
    
13. What does ARP stand for? `Address Resolution Protocol`
    
14. What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address? `Request`
    
15. What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network? `MAC Address`
    
16. What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network? `IP Address`
    
17. What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to **retrieve an IP address?** `DHCP Discover`
    
18. What type of DHCP packet does a device **send once it has been** **offered an IP address** by the DHCP server? `DHCP Request`
    
19. Finally, **what is the last** DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server? `DHCP ACK`
