In this article, I will write a write-up for Linux Fundamentals Part 2 that covers Accessing Your Linux Machine using SSH(deploy), Introduction to Flags and Switches, Filesystem Interaction, Permissions 101, and Common Directories

1. What directional arrow key would we use to navigate down the manual page? `down`
    
2. What flag would we use to display the output in a "human-readable" way? `-h`
    
3. How would you create the file named "newnote"? `touch newnote`
    
4. On the deployable machine, what is the file type of "unknown1" in "tryhackme's" home directory? `ASCII text`  
      
    To interact with the machine run this command `$ ssh tryhackme@10.10.157.21` the IP Address might be different check yours, the password is `tryhackme`, refer to the Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH(Deploy if stuck). This will allow you to access the `tryhackme` folder that has the `important`, `myfile`, and `unknown1` files as well as `myfolder` folder which will be relevant in answering some questions about this room
