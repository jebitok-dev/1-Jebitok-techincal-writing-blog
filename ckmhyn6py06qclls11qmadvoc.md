Over the past few months [Zuri Academy](https://training.zuri.team/) has been organizing for its first software development beginners training. Last month applications were opened and early this week over 17,000 applicants were accepted for the training in different tracks i.e Frontend(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript- React as the JS library),  Back-end(Node.js, PHP), mobile(flutter), data science(python) and UI/UX design (Figma). 

The training will take four months with the learning phase and project development phase as well as incorporating career development over the program. Learners will be guided by experienced industry mentors in the various tasks and slack will be the major communication tool.

Personally, I was accepted and I'm looking forward to learning, as much as I have spent a year now learning software development going for a beginner program at Zuri means a lot since most of the mentors of the program are HNG Internship mentors, finalists, and products. Last year I went through an HNG internship and realized that most people who went through the same program as Zuri last year were more aware of industry standards and were more likely to be HNG finalists and do quality tasks than the rest of us.

My aim in this program is to master my CSS and web page development skills well since this has been my major challenge. Learning alongside Nigerian developers and developers is always a double motivation and blessing since you're amongst smart people who are willing to go for it and to share with others.

Zuri training is sponsored by [ingressive4Good](https://ingressive.org/) which has been a key player in supporting software development programs across Africa through sponsoring training, job access support, and funding junior & beginners through laptops amongst other ways. This year Ingressive4Good is targeting to invest $1M to train over 1M youths and link youths to over 5000Jobs. 

Looking forward to benefiting both from [Zuri Team](https://training.zuri.team/), [Ingressive4Good](https://ingressive.org/), and fellow learning. 

*WE KEEP MOVING!*
