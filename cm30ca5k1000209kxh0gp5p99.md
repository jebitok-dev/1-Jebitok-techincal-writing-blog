In this article, I will write a write-up for Digital Forensics Fundamentals that covers Introduction to Digital Forensics, Digital Forensics Methodology, Evidence Acquisition, and Windows Forensics.

1. Which team was handed the case by law enforcement? `digital forensics`
    
2. Which phase of digital forensics is concerned with correlating the collected data to draw any conclusions from it? `Analysis`
    
3. Which phase of digital forensics is concerned with extracting the data of interest from the collected evidence? `Examination`
    
4. Which tool is used to ensure data integrity during the collection? `write blocker`
    
5. What is the name of the document that has all the details of the collected digital evidence? `chain of custody`
    
6. Which type of forensic image is taken to collect the volatile data from the operating system? `Memory Image`  
      
    If you take the above coordinates and search one of the online maps, you will learn more about this location. Searching [Microsoft Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps) [or Google Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps) [for `51 deg`](https://www.google.com/maps) `30' 51.90" N, 0 deg 5' 38.73" W` reveals the street where the photo was taken. Note that for the search to work, we had to replace `deg` with `°` and remove the extra white space. In other words, we typed `51°30'51.9"N 0°05'38.7"W` in the map search bar.  
    
7. Using `pdfinfo`, find out the author of the attached PDF file, `ransom-letter.pdf`. `Ann Gree Shepherd`

8. Using `exiftool` or any similar tool, try to find where the kidnappers took the image they attached to their document. What is the name of the street? `Milk Street`
