On Friday world's Richest man [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) added ```#Bitcoin``` on his Twitter bio and tweeted 

``` In retrospect, it was inevitable```. 

This comes a month after Bitcoin hit its ATH(All-Time-High) of $ 41, 999 on BTC/USDT rate and the current price has been ranging from $29k to $38k over the past weeks and it's expected to rise.  

During this time(late December to January), we saw crypto influencers and investors together with key market actors especially those linked to Bitcoin like [Michael Saylor](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor)  whose company, [MicroStrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/en) owns over 70,784 BItcoins and claims to #hodl over 17,732 BTC:

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Some have asked how much #BTC I own. I personally #hodl 
17732 BTC which I bought at $9,882 each on average. 
I informed MicroStrategy of these holdings before 
the company decided to buy #bitcoin for itself
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Michael Saylor has been calling for a meetup with Elon Musk to discuss bitcoin and convenience him to buy or help him convert his companies Balance Sheet into Bitcoin supported. Michael Saylor is popular for owning a huge number of bitcoin and being a great advocate of bitcoin, especially for huge corporations. He also has been talking a number of podcast episodes' about bitcoin and seen on media interviews.

On the end of crypto markets, Binance has turned to be the most popular crypto exchange site that has been most stable during this times when prices of cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin, Ethereum, $DOGE among others have attained their ATH and gaining more popularity and adoption globally.

After Elon Musk has shown his interests in bitcoins tweets made by [CZ_Binance](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/) back in 2018 have resurfaced at that point he had told Elon Musk that if he invests or accepts cryptocurrencies he will buy a Tesla. The Crypto community are on the watch if CZ Binance will heed his vow since he's popularly known as a minimalist for owning no car, no house, not married, shaves his own hair, survives on egg sandwiches but more often he responds to fans speculations by saying: [CZ_Binance](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1313880909305659392):

There are 24h in a day. If you had to choose between spending
it on:

1. Taking care of car, house, jet, and clothes... Or
2. Increasing freedom of money for billions in the world

Not everyone has option 2. I am thankful to have the chance to
