Over time, both experienced and newbies are looking for ways to get started with open-source software (OSS) as contributors either as developers, designers, technical writers, testers, marketers, etc. It is amazing that there is growth in the number of open-source communities and advocates. That supports contributors to OS through guidance and maintenance of open-source projects.

First, identify a community or project to contribute to and follow the rules often provided on the docs "How to Contribute" then identify an issue you're able to contribute to and request to be assigned to it. Most projects require that you fork their project repository in order for you to create a pull request and request for review after you have made changes. To set-up project locally you:-

````
// forked repository
$ git clone (https-or-ssh_key:link-to-the-forked-repository)
$ git checkout -b branch-name
$ git remote add upstream link-to-the-main repo
$ git pull upstream master
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push -u origin HEAD
````
