In this article, I will write a write-up for OWASP Top 10 - 2021 that covers Broken Access Control, IDOR Challenge, Cryptographic Failures with Support Materials and Challenges, Injection, Command Injection, Insecure Design, Secure Misconfiguration, Vulnerable and Outdated Components, Identification and Authentication Failures, Sofware and Data Integrity Failures, Security Logging and Monitoring Failures, and Server-Side Request Forgery(SSRF).

1. Deploy the machine and go to [http://](http://machine_ip/)MACHINE\_IP - Login with the username noot and the password test1234. Look at other users' notes. What is the flag? `flag{fivefourthree}`
    

there’s a hint that the id can be lower than if you put the id to be 0 you get the flag we’re looking for also note the note.php on the path

    Navigate to [http://MACHINE\_IP:84](http://machine_ip:84/) where you'll find a vulnerable application. All the information you need to exploit it can be found online.
    
    Answer the questions below
    
17. What is the content of the /opt/flag.txt file? `THM{But_1ts_n0t_my_f4ult!}`

To see this in action, go to [http://MACHINE\_IP:8088](http://machine_ip:8088/) and try to register with `darren` as your username. You'll see that the user already exists, so try to register " darren" instead, and you'll see that you are now logged in and can see the content present only in darren's account, which in our case, is the flag that you need to retrieve.

19\. What is the flag that you found in darren's account? `fe86079416a21a3c99937fea8874b667`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730518934285/cff05967-b1a6-43ab-9aa5-aa5421662ad7.png align="center")

20\. Now try to do the same trick and see if you can log in as arthur.  

21\. What is the flag that you found in arthur's account? `d9ac0f7db4fda460ac3edeb75d75e16e`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730518885087/48ced80f-c262-40ad-b8fe-4ac03b531ff3.png align="center")

22. What is the SHA-256 hash of `https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js`? `sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ=`

It sounds pretty simple! Let's walk through the process an attacker would have to follow in an example scenario. Navigate to [http://MACHINE\_IP:8089/](http://machine_ip:8089/) and follow the instructions in the questions below.

23\. Try logging into the application as guest. What is guest's account password? `guest`  
  
The login error message has the guest’s password

24\. What is the name of the website's cookie containing a JWT token? `jwt-session`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730518765111/cbcb8cad-71d7-43dd-b539-aedcb2dad288.png align="center")

25\. Use the knowledge gained in this task to modify the JWT token so that the application thinks you are the user "admin".

26\. What is the flag presented to the admin user? `THM{Dont_take_cookies_from_strangers}`

27\. What IP address is the attacker using? `49.99.13.16`

28\. What kind of attack is being carried out? `Brute Force`

Navigate to [http://MACHINE\_IP:8087/](http://machine_ip:8087/), where you'll find a simple web application. After exploring a bit, you should see an admin area, which will be our main objective. Follow the instructions on the following questions to gain access to the website's restricted area!

29\. Explore the website. What is the only host allowed to access the admin area? `localhost`

30\. Check the "Download Resume" button. Where does the server parameter point to? [`secure-file-storage.com`](http://secure-file-storage.com/)

31\. Using SSRF, make the application send the request to your AttackBox instead of the secure file storage. Are there any API keys in the intercepted request? `THM{Hello_Im_just_an_API_key}`
