To solve this challenge one needs to read through the User and Group theory to under the default user and username created when a new OS is downloaded. Also, that username is created within the /home path and that a username is limited to 32 characters so it can be the username can't be the entire `ctf@wlem5p6v4dgax3g1mqvr8ddh23okj6zqddqlt639-web-654b7b8dc6-hxdzf` since about 64 characters. We have to know the username which is ctf and also to access the username through the /home/username path.  
  
The flag is said to be a secret user -&gt; flag{}. Here we can see the SuperSecretUser13337 automatically that will be what we are looking for so we will place it inside the flag{} and submit the challenge.
