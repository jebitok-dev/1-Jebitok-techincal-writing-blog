In this article, we’ll cover the Sandboxes - If I can't find a nice malware to use, I'm not going, write-up as the Day 6 challenge of the Advent of Cyber event challenge. It was interesting to use YARA on Windows sandbox to detect malware using commands and to implement an evasion technique to bypass YARA rule detection. We’re still at Wareville for SOC-mas!

1. What is the flag displayed in the popup window after the EDR detects the malware? `THM{GlitchWasHere}`
