Software development is a fast-growing field. A lot of people are getting into the field. Here are key points to keep in mind while building your career in software development:-
- Time management
- starting from basics
- following instructions
- paying attention to trends.

In regards to time management especially as a newbie in tech, it's important to plan your time well. If you're learning let's say 2 or 3 hours per day or over 8 hours. You have to optimize your time well and try to discipline yourself with it. Most projects you'll be working on comes with time limits. You might get a full-time remote job where you're expected to work  8 hours. Failure to build on a good time management culture might limit the ability to work in teams/delivering tasks.

It's important to start with basics when learning programming /markup language. There are many frameworks and libraries linked to a specific language. As a beginner don't learn library/ framework before familiarizing yourself well with the basic language. For example:-

- For pure CSS, start with the whole idea of grid/flex-box among others before learning any other CSS framework/library eg Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.

- For JavaScript, start building projects using Vanilla JavaScript until you're comfortable with it. From there you'll be able to learn framework/libraries like React, Node.js, Vue.js, Angular, etc

When working on tech projects, follow outlined instructions linked to details of the project.  Follow up with the project manager/ team lead as they layout tasks. If your inactive other members will end up working as expected and this might cost your chances of working well with the team or giving them a hard time.

Last but not least, tech is a world with a large number of developers, designers, etc, and each day new technologies or updates are being made. Building good career progress gets discussed within communities. It's good for you as a person in tech especially as a newbie to join more than one community. Joining communities help you:-
- building a career through contributing to open-source projects
- getting guidance on how to approach job interviews
- solving algorithms and data structure
- keep track of upcoming trends like shift to web 3.0.
