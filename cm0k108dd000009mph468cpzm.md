I'm currently taking Cybersecurity by I4G in collaboration with [Cisco Network Academy](https://www.netacad.com) and in this article, I will be putting together some questions and answers for the introduction to the cybersecurity module.

## CyberAttackers Category

1. After hacking into ATM systems remotely using a laptop, this attacker worked with the ATM manufacturers to resolve the identified security vulnerabilities. `Gray hat`
    
2. This attacker transferred $10 million into their bank account using customer account and PIN credentials gathered from recordings. `Black hat`
    
3. This attacker’s job is to identify weaknesses in a company’s computer system.`White hat`
    
4. This attacker used malware to compromise a company’s system and steal credit card information that was then sold to the highest bidder. `Black hat`
    
5. While carrying out some research, this attacker stumbled across a security vulnerability on an organization's network that they are authorized to access. `White hat`
    

## Types of Malware Category

1. Malware designed to track your online activity and capture your data `Spyware`
    
2. Software that automatically delivers advertisements `Adware`
    
3. Malware that holds a computer system captive until a payment is made to the attacker `Ransomware`
    
4. Malicious code that attaches to legitimate programs and usually spreads by USB drives, optical media, network shares, or email `Virus`
    
5. Malicious code that replicates itself independently by exploiting vulnerabilities in networks `Worms`
    

Thanks for reading through my article. At the moment I hope that I will remain consistent in this learning journey and keep practicing as the days and months come by.
