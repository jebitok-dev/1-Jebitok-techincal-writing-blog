Over the past few months, tech Twitter has gone wild on the conversation around web3 a lot of software developers, designers, cyber security specialists, project managers, developer advocates are eyeing to understand what web3 is all about, how they can start and build a career around. It's been interesting seeing a lot of web3 developers and influencers like [Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3), [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC), [Stephen Fluin](https://twitter.com/stephenfluin), [Preethi Kasireddy](https://twitter.com/iam_preethi), [CatMcGee](https://twitter.com/CatMcGeeCode), [Oliver Jumpertz](https://twitter.com/oliverjumpertz), [Eda](https://twitter.com/edatweets_), [Noah Hein](https://twitter.com/NHeinDev), [Samina](https://twitter.com/saminacodes), [Vitto Rivabella](https://twitter.com/VittoStack), [Kacie Ahmed](https://twitter.com/Haezurath) sharing resources, roadmaps, and building communities that can allow developers to get started.
