The Tech world is growing adversely and is considered the future of work especially with the rise of remote jobs and the adoption of automation and software technologies widely.

When you decide you want to dive into tech-first determine the track you want to major on in order to avoid wasting time switching from one track to the other. 

*track in tech with popular languages*

- web development 
> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python

- Game Development
> C++, C#, Java, JavaScipt

- Data Science 
> Python, R, Scala, SQL, Java

- Artificial Intelligence
> Python, R, Java, C++

- Mobile Development
> Java, Kotlin, Swift, JavaScript, Dart(Flutter)

- Cyber Security
> C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP

- Product Design 
> Figma, Photoshop

Next, you have to determine the learning resources you're going to use. You can either join a Bootcamp training either in-person training or remote with this option you won't have to choose the track since it's determined by the track offered by the Bootcamp you'll join. Alternatively, you can choose to use online learning resources which are either: free or paid. 

I will only touch on web development resources since it's the most popular track and I have gone through though there's a campaign that more newbies are encouraged to take up those other tracks that are seen as competitive and most challenging. For web development you can use:
- [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org/learn)
> This free course covers web design(HTML & CSS), JavaScript, Data Structures & Algorithms, Front-end Frameworks & technologies, Data Visualization, Python, APIs & Microservices, information security ..et al as a full-stack course

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
> Free full-stack course that covers JavaScript among other web development languages along with either Ruby on rails or Node.js environment and for the back-end. You'll choose Full-Stack JavaScript with Node.js or Full-Stack Ruby.

- [Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) 
> this is a paid course but it's in high demand and a lot of people have confirmed to relate or understand her teachings well.

- Youtube crash courses or web development courses. 
> You can search for courses from top recommended YouTubers like [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/thenetninja?reload=9), [DevEd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) among others.
 Alongside courses, you'll also need books especially if you're starting off. For JavaScript, you can read: *Eloquent JavaScript, Don't know JS, JavaScript Grammar* among others.

- Git and GitHub is also essential in your coding journey if you're not yet familiar you can use this [netninja series](https://youtu.be/3RjQznt-8kE)

- code editor: you can download [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) since it has helpful extensions like *live server, live share, and git lens* and easy to use. Once installed you can integrate with git.

- browser: either *Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, or Chromium*

- Operating System: depending on your PC i.e Mac or you can use Windows or Linux Distros e.g Ubuntu
