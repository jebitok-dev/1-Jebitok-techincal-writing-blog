In this article, I have written writeups for the SDLC section of DevSecOps of THM. For more context, you can visit the TryHackMe platform

1. How many phases can an SDLC have? (Format X-Y) `6-8`
    
2. What phase focuses on determining the first idea for a prototype? `Requirements Definition`
    
3. What stage is also known as the "Feasibility Stage"? `Planning Stage`
    
4. When do you outline the user interfaces and network requirements? `Design and Prototyping`
    
5. What phase focuses on handling issues or bugs reported by end-users? `Operations and Maintenance`
    
6. What phase involves releasing new versions of software? `Deployment`
    
7. What phase ensures software meets the standards defined in the requirements phase? `Testing`
    
8. What does CALMS stand for? `Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing`
    
9. What 2 metrics are used to measure deployment agility? `Deployment speed and frequency`
    
10. What is an essential rate for engineers in Production environments to know if code meets security requirements? `Failure rate`
    
11. What is the measurement for recovery time after a failure? `MTTR`
    
12. What is the flag that you receive once you have doubled the empire's investment? `THM{Ruler.of.the.SDLC.Droids}`
    

I put the number of developers to be 3 and 10 sprints. Then I distributed one sprint per phase except software development which has 4 then clicked to show the results, displayed all 12 months then clicked show results which eventually showed the flag (make sure the number of sprints is zero so that you can move to the last part and revenue should also double up)
