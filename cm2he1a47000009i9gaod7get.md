In this article, I will write the write-up for the [Packet and Frames](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/packetsframes) walkthrough from TryHackMe. This covers what packets and frames are, TCP/IP Three-Way Handshake, UDP/IP, and Ports 101.

1. What is the name for a piece of data when it **does have** IP addressing information? `Packet`
    
2. What is the name for a piece of data when it **does not have** IP addressing information? `Frame`
    
3. What is the header in a TCP packet that ensures the integrity of data? `checksum`
    
4. Provide the order of a normal Three-way handshake (with each step separated by a comma) `SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK`
    
5. What is the value of the flag given at the end of the conversation? `THM{TCP_CHATTER}`
    
6. What does the term "UDP" stand for? User Datagram Protocol
    
7. What type of connection is "UDP"? `Stateless`
    
8. What protocol would you use to transfer a file? `TCP`
    
9. What protocol would you use to have a video call? `UDP`
    
10. **Practical Challenge:**
    
    Open the site attached to this task and connect to the IP address "**8.8.8.8**" on port "**1234**", and you'll receive a flag.
    
    Answer the questions below
    
    What is the flag received from the challenge? `THM{YOU_CONNECTED_TO_A_PORT}`
