In this article, we’ll cover the Atomic Red Team - I’m all atomic inside! The write-up is called the Day 4 challenge of the Advent of Cyber event challenge. It was interesting to understand and navigate through the Cyber Attacks & the Kill Chain, the [Atomic Red Library](https://www.atomicredteam.io/) which is a red team test case that is mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework. We’re still at Wareville for SOC-mas!

As Glitch continues to prepare for SOC-mas and fortifies Wareville's security, he decides to conduct an attack simulation that would mimic a ransomware attack across the environment. He is unsure of the correct detection metrics to implement for this test and asks you for help. Your task is to identify the correct atomic test to run that will take advantage of **a command and scripting interpreter**, conduct the test, and extract valuable artifacts that would be used to craft a detection rule.

Answer the questions below

1. What was the flag found in the .txt file that is found in the same directory as the PhishingAttachment.xslm artefact? `THM{GlitchTestingForSpearphishing}`
