In this article, I will write a write-up for Logs Fundamentals that covers Introduction to Logs, Types of Logs, Windows Event Logs Analysis, and Web Server Access Logs Analysis.

1. Where can we find the majority of attack traces in a digital system? `Logs`
    
2. What is the name of the last user account created on this system? `hacked`

4. On what date was this user account enabled? Format: M/D/YYYY `6/7/2024`
    
5. Did this account undergo a password reset as well? Format: Yes/No `Yes`
    

If you are downloading the log file for the analysis, some browsers like Chrome would block downloading it because it contains IP addresses, URLs, and User agent strings that may be flagged as malicious by their security mechanisms. You can click “Keep file” or any other alternative option available in your browser after it blocks the download.

6. What is the IP which made the last GET request to URL: “/contact”? `10.0.0.1`

7. When was the last POST request made by IP: “172.16.0.1”? `06/Jun/2024:13:55:44`
