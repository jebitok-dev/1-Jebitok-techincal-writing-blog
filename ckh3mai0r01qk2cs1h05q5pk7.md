More often I come across [#100daysofcode tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100daysofcode&src=typed_query) on Twitter, Normally it's who are sharing their progress on the 100 days journey of commitment. [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is an initiative that was started by [Alex Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away) it aims at having developers to commit at least 1 hour daily to coding and those who commit to it are encouraged to share there daily progress on Twitter, any other social media platform or on the [#100daysofcode repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) where one *forks the repo* and enters there daily progress, thoughts and link of the project or solution to algorithms you have been working/solving respectively on the log.md file

I always thought that this initiative has specific resources that if you decide today that I want to jump on #100daysofcode I will have to start using the given curriculum that I'll complete within 100 days but when I started my 100days which at the moment I'm on day 40 I learned that there are no set resources it's just upon you to choose the resources, projects or skills you want to achieve within the 100days and how you are you are going to ensure that you're going to optimize at least 1 hour daily to gain skills and make it count. 

Remember this 100daysofcode isn't for people who have been coding for a while even if you're a beginner you start your #100daysofcode. This is just to help you be accountable for what you learn daily for a period of 3months after which you can start the counting again another 100daysofcode if it ends being impactful to you.

*Pomodoro Technique*

When participating in #100daysofcode you can borrow the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which is a time management method where one uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. You set your timer for 25 minutes when you get disrupted within the 25 minutes you start another 25 minutes again then you take a short break and start the next 25 minutes this way you'll be productive and will able to achieve at least 1 hour of coding daily.

*Resources*

In case you're on the web development track you can use:-
- *[vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [github](https://github.com/), [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)* - essentials
- the [freecodecamp curicullum](freecodecamp.org/learn) popular curicullum that covers

- [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/) for Full Stack Ruby on Rails or Full Stack JavaScript with Nodejs curriculum
- the [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for coding challenges where you choose a challenge, code the design, submit, and get feedback from others.
- [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) that has public courses:- 

> *in-progress* (if you have started)

> *most popular courses*

> *Learn GitHub with GitHub*

> *languages and tools*

> *learning paths* (you can select one)

> *GitHub Actions*

> *DevOps with GitHub* 

> *Enterprise on GitHub*

- [#100daysofcode Motivational podcast](https://t.co/SglB4Jvdj9?amp=1) by [treehouse](https://twitter.com/treehouse) where experienced developers or those who have gone through the 100daysofcode share advice and tips that have worked for them.
- [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for code practice

If you have more resources you can share and wishing you well if you decide to take up the challenge or you're going on with it. If you see someone publicly committing to the challenge motivate them that will really count eventually.
