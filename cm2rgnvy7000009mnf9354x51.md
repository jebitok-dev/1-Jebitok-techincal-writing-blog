In this article, I will write a write-up for Linux Fundamentals Part 1 that covers A Bit of Background on Linux, Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser), Running Your First Few Commands, Interacting With the Filesystem, Searching for Files, and An Introduction to Shell Operators.

1. Research: What year was the first release of a Linux operating system? `1991`
    
2. If we wanted to output the text "**TryHackMe**", what would our command be? `echo TryHackMe`
    
3. What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine? `tryhackme`
    
4. On the Linux machine that you deploy, how many folders are there? `4`
    
5. Which directory contains a file? `folder4`
    
6. What is the contents of this file? `Hello World`
    
7. Use the cd command to navigate to this file and find out the new current working directory. What is the path? `/home/tryhackme/folder4`

8. Use grep on "access.log" to find the flag that has a prefix of "THM". What is the flag? `THM{ACCESS}`

9. If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use? `&`
    
10. If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be? `echo password123 > passwords`
    
11. Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be `echo tryhackme >> passwords`
